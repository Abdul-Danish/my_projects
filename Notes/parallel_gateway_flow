Exclusive Gateway flow:

	- NotificationService (line: 105)
	- GatewayEventProcessor
	- 



parallel Gateway flow:

	- GatewayEventProcessor -> parallelGateWayImpl (returns: null/Flownode)-> processActivity 

			-> publish event (ACTIVITY EVENT) -> EventProcessor (ACTIVITY) -> NodeProcessor (returns) 

			-> AbstractFlowNodeProcessor (returns) 

			-> EventProcessor (sends to: notificationTopic) (ORCHESTRATION EVENT) 

			-> NotificationListener (ORCHESTRATION) -> NotificationService -> ---

	Redis Repositories:

		@ EndGateWayRepository

			- event.getInstanceId() + ":" + gateWay.getId() 
			(cache individual gateway tasks/activity response and merge it at end)

		@ EventCacheRepository:

			- event.getInstanceId() + ":" + event.getCurrentActivity() + ":" + event.getIndex()
			(stores "ProcessParallelGatewayTask(s)")

			- sequenceFlow.getSourceRef() + ":" + RESPONSE
			(retrieve all the parallel responses)




@ FlowNode:

information about incoming and outgoing nodes/tasks/activities
