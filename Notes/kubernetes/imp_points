## Cluster vs Node in k8s:

* In Kubernetes, a cluster is a collection of nodes that work together to run containerized applications, serving as the overarching orchestration system. 
It consists of a control plane (master) that manages the cluster and one or more worker nodes. 
The control plane handles scheduling, deployment, and management of workloads across the nodes.


* A node is an individual machine—either physical or virtual—that acts as a worker unit within the cluster.
 Nodes provide the computing resources (CPU, memory, storage) necessary to run containerized applications.
 Each node runs essential services like the kubelet, which communicates with the control plane, a container runtime to manage containers, and kube-proxy to handle networking.
 Nodes are the actual hosts where pods are scheduled and executed.


 * A cluster is the complete system that manages and coordinates multiple nodes, while a node is a single machine within that system responsible for hosting and running workloads.


* A cluster enables scalability and fault tolerance by distributing workloads across multiple nodes.
 If a node fails, Kubernetes can reschedule the pods running on it to other available nodes, ensuring high availability.
 In contrast, a single node cluster lacks this redundancy and is more vulnerable to failure.
