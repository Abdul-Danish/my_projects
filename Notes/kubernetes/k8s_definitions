## Cluster vs Node in k8s:

* In Kubernetes, a cluster is a collection of nodes that work together to run containerized applications, serving as the overarching orchestration system. 
It consists of a control plane (master) that manages the cluster and one or more worker nodes. 
The control plane handles scheduling, deployment, and management of workloads across the nodes.


* A node is an individual machine—either physical or virtual—that acts as a worker unit within the cluster.
 Nodes provide the computing resources (CPU, memory, storage) necessary to run containerized applications.
 Each node runs essential services like the kubelet, which communicates with the control plane, a container runtime to manage containers, and kube-proxy to handle networking.
 Nodes are the actual hosts where pods are scheduled and executed.


 * A cluster is the complete system that manages and coordinates multiple nodes, while a node is a single machine within that system responsible for hosting and running workloads.


* A cluster enables scalability and fault tolerance by distributing workloads across multiple nodes.
 If a node fails, Kubernetes can reschedule the pods running on it to other available nodes, ensuring high availability.
 In contrast, a single node cluster lacks this redundancy and is more vulnerable to failure.


## Pod (apiVersion: v1) :

* It is the smallest deployable unit of computing that can be created and managed within a cluster in k8s.

* It is a single instance of a running process and typically encapsulates one or more containers that are tightly coupled and share resources such as storage, networking, and a specification for how to run the containers.
(it's one container per pod typically)

## Service (apiVersion: v1) :

* It is an API object that provides a stable network endpoint for a set of Pods, abstracting away their dynamic IP addresses and enabling reliable communication within or outside the cluster

## ReplicaSet (apiVersion: apps/v1) :

* A ReplicaSet's purpose is to maintain a stable set of replica Pods running at any given time. Usually, you define a Deployment and let that Deployment manage ReplicaSets automatically.

## Deployment (apiVersion: apps/v1) :

* It ensures the specified number of replicas are running and automatically replaces failed pods, maintaining application reliability and availability

## ConfigMap (apiVersion: v1) :

* ConfigMaps are designed to store non-sensitive configuration data, such as environment variables, configuration files, or application settings, and the data is stored in plain text format.

* They are commonly used to configure applications by injecting data as environment variables or mounting them as volumes within pods

## Secret (apiVersion: v1) :

* Secrets are intended for storing sensitive information like passwords, API keys, tokens, and TLS certificates.
* While the data in Secrets is also stored as key-value pairs, it is encoded in base64 format, providing a basic level of obfuscation to prevent accidental exposure

## targetPort:

* port where the backend is exposed

## port :

* port where the service is exposed, for other services to connect
